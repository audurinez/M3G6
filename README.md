Here i created a website for the Bíótekið festival running throught the fall in bíóparadís.
I found tailwind helpful and easy at times but other frustrating and difficult and sometimes "heftandi".
I found it a bit difficult to figure out how to have thing layer together in the right order. Like the info under the movieposters. and figuring out how to have the text hover over the posters. I had some help from Claude :) There I realised I had to group the text and image and have the image relative and text absolute. 

But it was fun to learn how to use tailwind. Def will use it in future coding.
